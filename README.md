# cloth-nappy-exchange

This app was created to provide an easy way 
to trade cloth nappies. The idea came about as 
I was apart of a Facebook group who handle this
trade in a way that got confusing of who was wanting
Nappies and who had them to donate. The founder who 
over saw the running of the page for free got bogged 
down with this so I wanted to make the process easier for her
as I felt it was a very helpful cause
